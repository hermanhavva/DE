#### Data Transformation using PySpark, Pandas or Polars (5 points):

1. **Requirements for dataset:** 3 csv files, one of which has more than a 100 000 records. 
2. **Retrieve data**: read data from a CSV file using Python.

3. Use PySpark, Pandas, or Polars to perform the following **transformations**:
  - Filter rows based on specific conditions (e.g., remove rows with missing values or filter by a specific column value).
  - Sort the data based on one or more columns. 
  - Aggregate data (e.g., group by a column and calculate sum, average, count, etc.). 
  - Join multiple datasets (if applicable) using a common key. 
  - Add new columns derived from existing columns (e.g., calculate a new metric or apply a function).

4. **Output result set.**
5. **Compare approaches**: _Pandas VS Polars_ or _PySpark VS Pandas_ or _PySpark VS Polars_.
